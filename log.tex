\maketitle

The purpose of the learning log is to reflect upon your progress in learning the
content of SE 2AA4/ CS 2ME3.  This is a personal journal.  The intention is for
you to be aware of your progress by means of recording and reflecting.  A
template is provided for each week.  You should fill in the question marks.  You
are also free to add your own subsections.

\section {Week \theweeknum \addtocounter{weeknum}{1} Intro to Course}

\subsubsection *{Dates} Jan 6 to Jan 10

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Introduction to Course}

Simple introduction to the course. Apparently this Parnas guy is going to appear frequently in this course.

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Software
  Engineering Profession}

Correctness in software is extemely important, as software failures can have catostrophic affects, both financial and social (can even cause loss of life). For example, we briefly mentioned a couple of examples of Software failures in real life, including the infamous Ariane 5 disaster.

\subsubsection *{Tutorial \thetutnum \addtocounter{tutnum}{1} Git, Doxygen and A1}

Git is a version controling system for software, which can be very important when you need to find old code. Doxygen is a tool that automatically generates documentation for your code given a specific commenting format.

\subsubsection *{Textbook Reading (Ghezzi, H\&S or other)}

Did not read the textbook.

\subsubsection *{Assignment Progress}

I didn't start the project this week.

\subsubsection *{Midterm/Final Review Progress}

Did not review for the midterm.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section {Week \theweeknum \addtocounter{weeknum}{1}}

\subsubsection *{Dates} Jan 13 to Jan 17

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1}}

Solidified the idea of requirements -> design -> implementation -> verification -> maintenance.

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1}}

Learnt about the various important traits of software (correctness, usability, maintainability, readability, efficiency, etc ...)

\subsubsection *{Tutorial \thetutnum \addtocounter{tutnum}{1}}

Learnt about the basics of latex, and how to compile .tex files on my computer. I also integrated LaTeX development through my own workflow, via LaTeX workshop in vscode.

\subsubsection *{Textbook Reading (Ghezzi, H\&S or other)}

Did not read this textbook section.

\subsubsection *{Assignment Progress}

Finished the majority of the code, documentation, and test cases for the Assignment. The problem/code itself was not difficult in the slightest, however it got me thinking about good code and documentation. It helped me understand the power of interface specifications, and how software specifications (like the one's we were given) can be extremely ambigous.

\subsubsection *{Midterm/Final Review Progress}

Did not review for the midterm/final.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section {Week \theweeknum \addtocounter{weeknum}{1} ?}

\subsubsection *{Dates} Jan 20 to Jan 24

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} ?}

Wasn't able to attend this lecture due to family circumstances.

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} ?}

Learned about abstraction via module interface specifications, which is important compenent of effective software design. It allows you to define the "interface"/"actions" of a module, without revealing the inner workings and implementation. All that matters to the user, is what each class/functions does. 

\subsubsection *{Tutorial \thetutnum \addtocounter{tutnum}{1} ?}

Reviewed important discrete math concepts relevant to the scope of this course and software engineering as a whole.

\subsubsection *{Textbook Reading (Ghezzi, H\&S or other)}

Did not read this textbook section.

\subsubsection *{Assignment Progress}

Completed the assignment and created a comprehensive list of test cases. I could've done the assignment in 20 different ways depending on what assumptions and implementations I used. I imagine that my partners test cases will fail because our differences in assumptions.

\subsubsection *{Midterm/Final Review Progress}

Did not review for the midterm of final this week.
